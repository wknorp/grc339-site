          <h2>Love Island</h2>
          <p>It’s been two months of quarantine and I’ve consumed 123 episodes of this absurd show. 
              I’m not sure if it’s the chaos, the staged-ness, or the personalities that make this show so mind-numbingly addictive, 
              but I would 10 out of 10 recommend.</p>
          <p>Warning: brain cells may be lost in the viewing of this show. </p>

          <h2>The Voice</h2>
          <p>Do you like hearing beautiful voices sing great music? Do you like John Legend? Do you like to shed a tear at dramatized sob stories? 
              Do you like watching people achieve their dreams? This is the reality show for you. </p>

          <h2>The Masked Singer</h2>
          <p>Is your brain filled with too much useless pop culture knowledge you don’t know what to do with? Do you like riddles and solving mysteries? 
              Can you put up with overkill cheesiness? Have you ever wanted to watch celebrities dress up as random fruits and animals and serenade you? 
              This will fulfill your very specific desires. </p>

          <h2>Songland</h2>
          <p>Can you tell I have a thing for singing competition shows...well if you, too, love singing competition shows this is one of my favorites. 
              Modern singers and songwriters come together with aspiring songwriters who collaborate with the biggest industry professionals to pitch 
              songs to some of the biggest artists today. The best part is that the artists actually do make the song afterward so you get to see popular 
              songs come together from start to finish. Big fan.</p>
